# NotesApp
this is a new web application to put all my coding notes of java, data structure, react and js in a easy to access web application.
currently my knowledge of java spring is limited so there will be no backend and all the code and notes will be stored as strings in typeScript files
but as soon as i finish my spring framework course, i will create a backend and store the data to be rendered in another server.
the components will be rendered in such a way that they work flawlessly weather the data is rendered from backend or is stored locally.
